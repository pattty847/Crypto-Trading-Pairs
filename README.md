# Crypto-Trading-Pairs
This file contains an Exchange class which can connect to ccxt exchanges and do things like pull candles, create a matrix of ticker closes, create a
cointegration heatmap for tickers passed to function, plot the spread, ratio, or zscore between two cryptos, and some other stuff.

I need to do a lot more, it's just a small project for now.
